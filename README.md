# pydata20180411

This repository contains the python notebook that I presented in my talk for the [PyData JHB April 2018 session](https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Johannesburg/events/249221227/).

The images used in the presentation are included in the ```images``` directory. Most of the data used in the presentation is in the ```data``` directory, however the _*NYPD Motor Vehicle Collisions*_ dataset is too large to host here and can be downloaded [here](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95) instead.

The original talk description from the meetup page:
>Data scientists spend most of their time cleaning data. You’ve probably heard the joke that “80 percent of data science is cleaning the data and 20 percent is complaining about cleaning the data.” Simon will be showing us what tools and tricks he uses dailly to make this task easier.

>## Title: Brushes, brooms, mops and buckets - some tools for delimited file messes>
>
>Talk description
>
>Flat files delimited by special characters are a quick way to extract and transfer data. They are used almost universally in data science. Unfortunately there are no good standards for these files. Files produced by other parties almost always require some kind of pre-processing. This talk explores a variety of tools (python libraries and command line tools) that the speaker uses to manipulate, clean and assess flat files.
